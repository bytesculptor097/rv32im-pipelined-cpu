## Validation Status

All instructions listed above have been:
- Simulated using minimal assembly programs
- Verified via waveform inspection
- Included in regression suites for control/data hazard scenarios

## Notes

- Instructions are decoded and executed with full pipeline support, including flush and hazard mitigation.
- Memory alignment and sign-extension are handled per RISC-V specification.
- Future extensions may include CSR instructions, floating-point operations, and interrupt handling.
